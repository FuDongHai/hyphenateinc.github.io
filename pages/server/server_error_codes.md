# Common Error Codes of Server-side REST API

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example of HTTP return results

After the REST interface calling, HTTP will use status code and the standard JSON format to return the  result. The specific error can be determined by the error field in the return data.

-   HTTP status return code 200 (success)
-   HTTP status return code 4xx (Request Error). These status codes indicate that the request may have error and interfere the processing of server.
-   HTTP status return code 5xx (Server Error) These status codes indicate that an internal error occurred while the server was attempting to process the request.

#### Return Example

![REST API返回错误示例](/start/450errorcode/response_icon.jpg)

It is recommended to do fault tolerance for the Easemob REST API results called by APP's own server side. For example, It should catch the exception returned by the interface calling, and the timeout errors should be retried. For system errors or errors after retries, they should be recorded in the system log and provide the alert to DevOps staff to do remedial measures, such as manual retransmission.

  Status Code                              Description
---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  400                          (Error request) The server does not understand the syntax of the request.
  401                          (Unauthorized) requests require authentication. For interfaces that require a token, the server may return this response.
  403                          (Forbidden) The server rejects the request. For group/chat room services, it represents that this call does not follow the correct operation logic of group/chat room, such as adding the member who is already in the group, or removing a member who does not exist in the chat room.
  404                          (Not found) The server could not find the interface to request.
  405                          (Wrong request method) Please follow the interface instructions on the official website of  Easemob and use the interface GET, POST and other request methods correctly.
  408                          (Request timeout) A timeout occurred while the server was waiting for the request.
  413                          (Request body is too large) If the request body is more than 5kb, please split it into smaller requests and retry.
  415                          The type of request body is not supported.
  429                          (Service unavailable) Requesting interface in a frequency which exceeds limit or exceed the community edition limit. Please contact business if needed.
  500                          (Internal server error) The server encountered an error and could not complete the request.
  501                          (Not yet implemented) The server does not have the function to complete the request. For example, the server may return this code if it cannot recognize the request method.
  502                          (Error Gateway) The server acts as a gateway or proxy and receives an invalid response from the uplink server.
  503                          (Server timeout) Service Unavailable.
  504                          (Gateway timeout) The server acts as a gateway or proxy and does not receive the request from the uplink server timely.
