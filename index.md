# IM Development File

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IM Development File V3.0

The AgoraChat instant messaging cloud PaaS platform V3.0 has carried out comprehensive and in-depth transformation and optimization of the SDK and communication protocol:

-   New communication protocol: a new proprietary protocol based on message synchronization, more stable and less traffic in unstable network environments, ensuring reliable, sequential and real-time delivery of messages, with increased security. It also provides better scalability and will support more docking and device synchronization scenarios.
-   New SDK: comprehensive refactoring to better encapsulate the core communication modules; Simplified interface, clearer structure, easier integration; Improved login speed and reliability in weak network environments.
